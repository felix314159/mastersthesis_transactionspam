# Code for my Master's thesis about transaction spam attacks in Ethereum

This rep contains code used for the experiments of my Master's Thesis.

Since the filesizes here are restricted, I will add a Google Drive to the private Berlin blockchain that I used for some experiments.
The other blockchain used for experiments can be set up by anyone by syncing to block 11567314 of mainnet.
