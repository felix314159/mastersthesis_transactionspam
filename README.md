# Code for my Master's thesis about transaction spam attacks in Ethereum

This rep contains code used for the experiments of my Master's Thesis.

Since the filesizes here are restricted, below you can find a Google Drive to the private Berlin blockchain (zip size ~250 MB) that I used for some experiments:

The other blockchain used for experiments can be set up by anyone by syncing to block 11567314 of mainnet (size > 900 GB using Geth).
